        <h1>The Founding Of The School</h1>
        <p>The Word of Faith Schools (WOFS) in Benin City trace their roots to a divine vision received by Archbishop Margaret Benson-Idahosa, who sought to create a nurturing environment where children could grow academically, spiritually, and creatively. That vision came to life in 1979, when the school began as a modest pre-school with just 23 children and three staff members, including the proprietress herself</p>
        <p>By 1982, the primary school was officially accredited by the Federal Government, and in 1984, the secondary school followed suit. The institution continued to expand, and by 2003, it had launched its first boarding facilities for both male and female students</p>
        <p>WOFS is part of the educational arm of the Church of God Mission International, founded by the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa, a pioneer of Pentecostalism in Nigeria. Today, the school has grown into a network of over 108 schools across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, known for its commitment to excellence and Christian values</p>
        <br>
        <h1>The Admin</h1>
        <p>The Word of Faith Group of Schools in Benin was founded through the vision of Archbishop Margaret Benson-Idahosa, who felt a divine calling to establish a school that nurtures children academically, spiritually, and creatively. The vision was brought to life in 1979, with the support of her husband, Archbishop Benson Idahosa, and began as a small pre-school with just 23 children and three staff members</p>
        <p>The school quickly expanded: the primary school was accredited in 1982, and the secondary school followed in 1984. Over the years, the institution has grown into a network of over 108 schools across Nigeria, all rooted in Christian values and academic excellence.</p>
        <P>The administration has remained closely tied to the founding family and the Church of God Mission International, with a strong emphasis on leadership that upholds the original vision.</P>
        <br>
        <h1>The Faculty</h1>
        <p>The faculty history of Word of Faith Group of Schools in Benin is deeply rooted in its founding vision of holistic Christian education. From its inception in 1979, the school began with just three staff members, including the visionary Archbishop Margaret Benson-Idahosa, who also served as the first head of faculty.</p>
        <p>As the school expanded—adding a primary school in 1982 and a secondary school in 1984—so did its academic team. The faculty grew to include educators who were not only academically qualified but also spiritually grounded, reflecting the school’s mission to develop students intellectually and morally.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the faculty has evolved into a diverse and dynamic team, with teachers trained in both Nigerian and international curricula. Many of them are alumni of the school or affiliated institutions like Benson Idahosa University, which shares the same founding legacy.</p>
